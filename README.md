ðŸ“¦ Dataset Overview
This dataset was constructed in a custom-built Augmented Reality-assisted Human-Robot Collaboration (AR-HRC) environment. It includes multi-modal recordings to support research in:
Human action recognition during collaborative assembly
Component detection and localization
Knowledge reasoning in industrial HRC scenarios
The full dataset is used in the publication:
"Probing AR-Assisted Seamless HRC Assembly for Industry 5.0: Multi-modal Mutual Cognition and LLM-Driven Knowledge Reasoning"
